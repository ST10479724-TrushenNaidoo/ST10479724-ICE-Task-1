9)The Terminal in VS Code is an integrated terminal that allows you to run command-line commands directly within the editor. The Command Prompt is a standalone system program in Windows for executing commands.

10)This line creates a text element that displays the words "Welcome to React and Node!" on the screen.

11) Expo Go is useful because it allows you to instantly test and preview your app on a real physical device during development without the need to install a native SDK or compile a build manually. You simply scan a QR code to open the latest version of your project.

12) You can use responsive styling with flexbox to ensure components resize correctly for different screen sizes. Additionally, you can use the Dimensions API or relative units to set widths/heights based on the screen's dimensions and use platform-specific components or styling that mimic native mobile UI patterns.

13) One major benefit is a unified language (JavaScript/TypeScript). Developers can use the same language for both the frontend (React Native) and the backend (Node.js), which simplifies development, code sharing, and context switching for full-stack teams.
